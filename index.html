        <h2>What is Flocking?</h2>

        <p>Flocking is an open source audio synthesis toolkit that runs inside your Web browser. 
           It doesn't require Flash or any other proprietary plugins. Written entirely in JavaScript, 
           Flocking is designed for artists and musicians building creative Web-based sound projects. 
           It is built on top of Firefox 4's Audio Data API and WebKit's WebAudio API. Flocking was inspired 
           by the SuperCollider desktop synthesis environment. If you're familiar with SuperCollider, you'll 
           feel at home with Flocking.</p>

        <p>Unlike comparable synthesis libraries, Flocking is declarative. Unit generators are wired 
            together using a simple JSON-based syntax, making it easy to save and share your synthesis 
            algorithms in plain text. Send your synths via Ajax, save them for later using HTML5 local data 
            storage, or parse them into formats compatible with other synthesis engines. In the future, this 
            JSON-based format will also enable better authoring tools and synthesis environments to be built 
            on top of Flocking.</p>

        <p>Flocking is light on dependencies--no classical inheritance systems or other funny stuff to 
            buy into. Just plain old objects and functions. jQuery is there to provide a bit of extra help, 
            but you're free to pick the frameworks and tools you love the best.</p>

        <p>Flocking is dual-licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses.</p>
